        <p>Denmarkâ€™s capital Copenhagen has multitudes of tourist attractions to please even the pickiest
            travelers. This Danish city has been attracting guests from around the world for years. The
            Scandinavian city seems to have everything one would love in a gateway - lots of water, greenery,
            adventure places, and a cozy atmosphere. Maritime Flair, the unique cafe culture, and friendly
            street life make tourists visit the place repeatedly. Located on the sea shore, Copenhagen gives you
            a distinctly European feel and is a perfect place for wandering through at your leisure. You can hop
            on a bike to explore the city highlights yourself or may have a travel guide beside you to give you
            personal travel tips. </p>
        <p><img src="{{ asset('asset/images/c-sm.jpg') }}" alt="Post image"></p>
        <p>Tivoli Gardens, Christiansborg Palace, The National Gallery of Denmark, and Amalienborg Castle are a
            few names of many that top the chart of tourist attractions. Visiting this city is extremely
            relaxing; throughout the city, you feel a nautical vibe reflected in the colorful shore-side homes
            and big ships docked along the quays. In addition, the place is also the home to many cutting-edge
            restaurants, including the famous Noma, where tables must be reserved months in advance.</p>
        <P>Moreover, people love cycling in Copenhagen; this city is one of the cycle-friendly cities in Europe.
            So, if you get one for yourself, explore the city. The weather in Copenhagen is also quite pleasant.
            We recommend summer as the best travel time (June to August), the temperature is mild and hardly
            gets hot here. So, pack your travel bag for an itinerary to Copenhagen, and Ces Collaborative will
            accompany you to make a captivating travel blog without interrupting the fun and excitement. We will
            capture the smallest details in our shoot that best describe your travel and the place. </P>
